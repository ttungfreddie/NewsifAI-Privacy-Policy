#NewsifAI Privacy Policy
NewsifAI is a browser extension that helps users evaluate whether online articles may be fake, misleading, or biased. Your privacy matters to us, and this page explains how data is handled when you use the extension.

Last updated: February 2026

Extension Version: 1.0

This privacy policy applies to the NewsifAI Chrome extension.

##Information We Process
When you choose to analyze text or enable auto-detection, NewsifAI processes:

##Text you manually paste into the extension, or
Visible article text from the webpage you choose to scan.
We do not intentionally collect personal information such as names, email addresses, account details, or precise location data.

##How the Information Is Used
The extracted text is sent to our AI model hosted at akch12-newsifai.hf.space solely to evaluate credibility and detect potentially fake content. The data is used only to generate analysis results and is not used for advertising, tracking, or profiling.

##Data Storage and Retention
NewsifAI does not permanently store analyzed webpage content. Text sent for analysis is processed temporarily and discarded after the analysis is completed.

User preferences (such as theme selection and auto-detect settings) are stored using Chrome’s built-in storage system and may be synced across the user’s own devices if Chrome sync is enabled.

##Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Data is transmitted only to the analysis endpoint required for the extension’s core functionality.

##Permissions
NewsifAI requests only the minimum permissions required to operate, including:

- Access to the active tab to analyze the page you are viewing
- Storage access to save user preferences
- Network access to communicate with the analysis service
All permissions are used strictly for user-initiated features.

#Security
We take reasonable measures to protect data in transit by using secure network requests. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.
